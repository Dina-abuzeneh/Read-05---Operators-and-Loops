# Read-05---Operators-and-Loops

# Expressions and operators
- describes JavaScript's expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more.

# Operators
- JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

1- Assignment operators

2- Comparison operators

3- Arithmetic operators

4- Bitwise operators

5- Logical operators

6- String operators

7- Conditional (ternary) operator

8- Comma operator

9- Unary operators

10 Relational operators

- javaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:

# operand1 operator operand2
For example, 3+4 or x*y.


A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator:

# operator operand

# Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.



# Compound assignment operators
Name	                         Shorthand operator	             Meaning

Assignment	                    x = y	                         x = y

Addition assignment           	x += y	                       x = x + y

Subtraction assignment	x -= y	x = x - y
Multiplication assignment	x *= y	x = x * y
Division assignment	x /= y	x = x / y
Remainder assignment	x %= y	x = x % y
Exponentiation assignment	x **= y	x = x ** y
Left shift assignment	x <<= y	x = x << y
Right shift assignment	x >>= y	x = x >> y
Unsigned right shift assignment	x >>>= y	x = x >>> y
Bitwise AND assignment	x &= y	x = x & y
Bitwise XOR assignment	x ^= y	x = x ^ y
Bitwise OR assignment	x |= y	x = x | y
Logical AND assignment	x &&= y	x && (x = y)
Logical OR assignment	x ||= y	x || (x = y)
Logical nullish assignment	x ??= y	x ?? (x = y)
